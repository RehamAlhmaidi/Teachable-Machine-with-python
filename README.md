# Image Recognition with Teachable Machine


## Overview
This project demonstrates how to train an image recognition model using Google's Teachable Machine, export it in TensorFlow format, and use a Python script to load the model and make predictions on new images.



## Features
- Trains an image recognition model with at least two classes.
- Exports the trained model in TensorFlow format.
- Loads the model and makes predictions using a Python script.
- Uses `tensorflow`, `numpy`, and `PIL` for image preprocessing and prediction.
- Provides high-confidence predictions for images.
- Supports easy integration with new datasets by retraining the model in Teachable Machine.



## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the script:

```sh
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow
```



## Project Structure
```
/
│-- TeachableM_AI.py         # Python script to load and use the model
│-- keras_model.h5           # Trained model file exported from Teachable Machine
│-- imagetest/               # Folder containing test images
```



## Usage
1. **Train the Model:**
   - Go to [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
   - Train an image classification model with at least two classes.
   - Export the trained model in TensorFlow (.h5) format.
   - Ensure that the class labels are correctly mapped.



2. **Download the Model:**
   - Place the exported `keras_model.h5` file in the project directory.



3. **Run the Python Script:**
   - Ensure `TeachableM_AI.py` is updated to use `keras_model.h5` as the model file.
   - Update the `img_path` to specify an image for testing.
   - Run the script:

   ```sh
   python TeachableM_AI.py
   ```


4. **Prediction Output:**
   The script will output the predicted class and confidence score, e.g.:

## How It Works
- The model is loaded using TensorFlow's `load_model` function.
- The input image is resized to match the expected dimensions (224x224 pixels).
- The image is converted into a NumPy array and normalized (scaled between 0 and 1).
- The model predicts the class label and confidence score.
- The highest confidence score determines the final classification.



## Notes
- Ensure the image used for prediction matches the model's expected input size (224x224 pixels).
- If the model path is incorrect, update `model = tf.keras.models.load_model("keras_model.h5")`.
- The accuracy of the model depends on the quality and quantity of training data.
- Additional preprocessing may improve prediction performance.



## Future Improvements
- Extend the model to recognize more classes by retraining in Teachable Machine.
- Optimize the prediction pipeline for real-time classification.
- Integrate with a web interface for easy image uploads and live predictions.
